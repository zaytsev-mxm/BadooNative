## BadooNative

![alt text](./preview.png)

This is a kind of pet project where I am trying to get into React Native.

If you want to see a live demo â€“ see this [video] or you can install this [apk] on your Android phone as well.

## How to use
To log in you can either register as a new user, or simply use login "test@test.com" and password "testtest"

When you write messages to someone, they are saved in Firebase, so you can see them 
again even after logging out and logging in back.

## TODO

- **[DONE!!!]** Fix navigation issues (at the moment a logged in user can get to the Login screen and get stuck there)
- **[DONE!!!]** Store the history of user's interactions in Firebase
- *[IN PROGRESS...]* Add more nice-looking custom UI components

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- React Native (with Expo)
- React Navigation
- Firebase
- OpenAI API
